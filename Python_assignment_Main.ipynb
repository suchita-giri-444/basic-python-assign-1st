Python is known for its simple, readable syntax, which makes it a great language for beginners. Unlike some other programming languages, Python doesn’t use complicated rules or symbols, so it's easier to understand and write.\n",

        "Python is popular for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Easy to learn: Python's syntax is simple, which makes it beginner-friendly. You can write programs quickly and focus more on learning concepts than on learning the language itself.\n",
